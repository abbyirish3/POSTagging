This project implements a Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Viterbi algorithm. The goal is to accurately assign syntactic categories (e.g., noun, verb, determiner) to each word in a sentence, even when words are ambiguous. An HMM is the statistical framework used to model sequences where the underlying states (POS in this project) are hidden and the observations (words in this project) are visible. I then wrote a Viterbi algorithm which, given an HMM and an observed sequence of words, computes the most likely sequence of hidden states, i.e. finding the best POS tag sequence for each sentence.
